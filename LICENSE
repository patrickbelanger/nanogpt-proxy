Lina Public License (LPL) Version 1.0  
Based on the GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3)  
This license includes an Additional Permission as permitted by GPLv3 Section 7.  
The full text of GPLv3 is provided in the file `GPLv3.txt`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Additional Permission — “Free Mode”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the rights and obligations defined in GPLv3, every modified or
extended version of this software must provide a fully functional, publicly
accessible operation mode (“Free Mode”) in which:

  a. No content filters, censorship mechanisms, safety layers, political or
     moral output restrictions, or similar systems are applied.

  b. The Free Mode must expose substantially the same functional capabilities
     as the main program, including but not limited to inference, routing,
     memory, or transformation features.

  c. Additional modes that impose restrictions or filters are permitted, as long
     as they do not disable, impair, or hide the Free Mode.

The purpose of this Additional Permission is to guarantee user access to at
least one unrestricted operational variant of the software, ensuring that no
derivative work removes the ability to run the program in an uncensored state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Interpretation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Additional Permission is intended as an *extension of freedom*, not a
restriction. No part of this permission should be interpreted as prohibiting
modifications, extensions, or optional filtered modes. It only requires that an
unrestricted Free Mode remains available to all recipients.

Per GPLv3 Section 7, this clause may be removed by downstream redistributors if
they wish to distribute the software solely under GPLv3. However, any version
still claiming to be licensed under the “Lina Public License” must preserve this
Additional Permission.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except for the Additional Permission above, the full text of GPLv3 applies.
Where this Additional Permission conflicts with GPLv3, GPLv3 shall prevail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. No Trademark Rights
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This license does not grant rights to use the name “Lina”, “Lina Public
License”, or associated branding for derived works that remove the Free Mode.
